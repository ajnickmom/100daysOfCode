    <H1>Rules of the Challenge:
    </H1>
    <h2>Start Date: January 5th, 2018</h2>
    <h3>I will code 1 hour every day for the next 100 days.</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I will tweet and post about my progress every day -> using the hashtag #100DaysOfCode.</li>
            <li>If I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.</li>
            <li>I will push code to GitHub every day so that anyone can see my progress.</li>
            <li>I will update the (Log)[log.md] with the day's progress and provide a link so that others can see my progress.</li>
            <li>I will work on real projects, facing real challenges. The time spent doing tutorials, online courses and other similar resources will NOT count towards this challenge. (If you've just started learning to code, read <a href ="faq.html">FAQ)</a></li>
        </ol>

<h2>Ideas To increase the chances of success:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>It's a requirement that you add a link to each of the day posts in the log. It can be a link to a commit on GitHub, a link to a blog post.</li>
        <li>If you get upset or stuck, read this article: <a href ="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd"></a>Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark</li>
        <li>If you don't know why there is such an emphasis on working on the projects vs doing tutorials or online courses, read this: <a href ="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645">How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year</a></li>
        <li>If you can't push your code to GitHub for some reason (e.g. if you're only starting to code and doing interactive exercises), provide a link to a tweet or post. You can think of something else as long as your challenge stays public - and you get the benefit of being committed to it and accountable for your progress.</li>
        <li>Another good bonus of forking this <a href="https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code.git"> repo</a> -> if you haven't worked with Markdown before, it's a good way to practice.to make this challenge more effective</li>

                <p>
                    <em></em>**Today's Progress:**</em> create a clone of GitHub from Kalloway's Challenge. Create a basic index.html updating meta info in head. Create a blog page where I list the rules of the challenge and I will post the log info. I put them into the standards for HTML headings and ordered list.  Added Links when appropriate
                    <em>**Thoughts:**</em>learning new things will be interesting as I keep repeating on my own the basics and rarely move foward. This will become my Web Portfolio and link to other common repositories for portfolios like Behance, LinkedIn, GitHub and others.
                    <em>**Link to Work**</em>
